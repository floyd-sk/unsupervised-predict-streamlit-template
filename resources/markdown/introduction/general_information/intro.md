**Problem Statement**

To build a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences.

This model will enable our comapny to give users personalized recommendations leading to customer satisfaction

**Data Overview**

This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems. For this project, we used a special version of the MovieLens dataset which has enriched with additional data, and resampled for fair evaluation purposes.
